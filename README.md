# ng-Spotify-Clone

## Project Purpose
This project was built in order to test my http request skills in abular and also challenge myself on layout using scss. How ever, this spotify cone does not have a play functionality because i do not have a premium spotify account. After checking spotify's apiendpoint. I found out that some endpoints cannot be accessed my free users of spotify, so i could not test the build with my account. Nevertheless. I will still update the UI and host it. Then i would continue to maintain the code and refactor the UI.
