This project was built in order to test my http request skills in angular and also challenge myself on layout using scss. However, this spotify clone does not have a play functionality because i do not have a premium spotify account. After checking spotify's api endpoint. I found out that some endpoints cannot be accessed by free users of spotify, so i could not test the build with my account. Nevertheless. I will still update the UI and host it. Then i would continue to maintain the code and refactor the UI...
