# ng-Spotify-Clone

## Project Purpose
This project was built in order to test my http request skills in angular and also challenge myself on layout using scss. However, this spotify cone does not have a play functionality because i do not have a premium spotify account. After checking spotify's api endpoint. I found out that some endpoints cannot be accessed by free users of spotify, so i could not test the build with my account. Nevertheless. I will still update the UI and host it. Then i would continue to maintain the code and refactor the UI.

Managing development and publishing is not an easy task.

## Final thoughts

From this project, i have learnt that no website or application has an ending until all its users are dead
